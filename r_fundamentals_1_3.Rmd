# Using R as a calculator

We can use R to do simple or advanced calculations for us. Remember to run the code by pressing the green play button or Ctrl + Enter (or Cmd + Enter on Mac).

```{r}
7 * 6
5 / (2^2)
(16 - 4) + (1 * 9)
```

## R as calculator exercise

Use R to work out the following arithmetic:

1)  `44 * 26`
2)  `9.6/1.6`
3)  `(12+4)^2`
4)  `(4*9)/(5+6)`
5)  `(22/36) * 100`
6)  The remainder of `55 / 2` (hint: look up r's modulus operator)

```{r}
# type your code here
44*26
9.6/1.6
(12+4)^2
(4+9)/(5+6)
(22/36)*100
55 %% 2

```

# Assigning variables

A variable is named storage of information. In our case today we are storing numbers.

We can assign variables by using `<-`. You should see the variable appear to your right in the global environment once you've run this command (under Values).

```{r}
height <- 155
```

We can then print the output of the variable by typing in its name.

```{r}
height
```

When calling a variable, be careful to type it exactly (you can also copy it or use code completion to help). The code below will give you an error because we have spelt height incorrectly.

```{r error=TRUE}
hieght
```

We can do calculations on variables. We first assign the variables and, then use them in the calculation.

In the example below, Score1 is 42, Score2 is 92 and so on. If we calculate `Score1 * Score2` what is really happening is `42 * 92`, as this is the data scored in those variables. Run the code, and review the output as well as the variables we have made in the global environment (top right panel in RStudio).

```{r}
# test scores
Score1 <- 42
Score2 <- 92
Score3 <- 68
# average score calculation
AveScore <- (Score1+Score2+Score3)/3
# print average score
AveScore
```

You will have noticed the hashtags (`#`) with text in the above example. These are called comments. In later R sessions we will use a lot of comments to tell us (and others) what each line or section of code is doing.

```{r}
# this is a comment
```

## Assigning variables exercise 1

1)  Make a variable called my_height, and assign your height in cm (this can be an estimate if you are not sure)
2)  Print the output of my_height
3)  Convert your height in cm to feet. Make a new variable called my_height_feet, and assign the calculation of your height in cm to feet. *hint: there are 0.0328084 feet in 1 cm*
4)  Print your my_height_feet variable

```{r}
# your code here
my_height <- 163
my_height
my_height_feet <- my_height*0.0328084
my_height_feet
```

## Assigning variables exercise 2

Use R to work out the body mass index (BMI) of someone who is 79kg, and 1.77m tall.

1)  Assign the variables of weight and height
2)  Assign the variable of BMI, and calculate the BMI based of the weight and height variables
3)  Print the outcome
4)  Add comments on what each line of code is doing

```{r}
# Exercise: BMI calculation
# assign variables of weight and height
weight <- 52
height <- 1.63

# BMI calculation
bmi<-weight/(height^2)

# print outcome
bmi
```

# Vectors

A vector is a set of information contained together in a specific order.

To make a vector you combine variables using the `c()` function (more on functions later); also known as concatenation. To call the `c()` function we use brackets () with the numbers we want separated by a comma.

The first way of making a vector is to add the arguments you want, numbers in this case.

**Run the below code chunks**

*Can you describe what is happening in each code chunk, and what the output means?*

```{r}
vect1 <- c(1,6,19,4,9)
vect1
```

We can also combine predefined variables and vectors to create a new vector.

```{r}
x <- 30
vect2 <- c(vect1, 22, 7, x)
vect2
```

Another way of making a vector is using the colon (`:`), which can be done without the c function. We can tell R to select a sequence of integers from x to y, or 5 through to 10 in our example.

```{r}
vect3 <- 5:10
vect3
```

We can also do some basic calculations on vectors. These occur elementwise (one element at a time).

```{r}
vect3/5
```

As you can see this divides all elements in the vector by 5.

# Functions: what are they and how to use them

A function is code organised together to perform a specific task. The function will take in an input, perform a task, then return an output. They are the backbone of R, which comes built in with a wide array of functions.

The **function(input)** format is the fundamental way to call and use a function in R. **function** is the name of the function we are using, **input** is the argument or data we are passing to the function.

For example:

```{r}
# running times (mins)
runTimes <- c(31, 50, 15, 19, 23, 34, 9)
# mean running time
aveRun <- mean(runTimes)
aveRun
# tidy up result
aveRun <- round(aveRun, digits = 2)
aveRun
```

Here we are using the functions `c()` to concatenate, `mean()` calculates the mean, and `round()` rounds to specific decimal places. Notice with the `round()` function we have `digits = 2`, which tells the function to round to two decimal places; this is called a *argument*.

## Functions exercise

We are on a walking exercise plan, where we increase our step count by a thousand each day, starting at 1000 steps and ending on 12000.

1)  Make a variable called steps using the `seq()` function that increases steps from 1000 to 12000 by increments of 500
2)  Workout the sum of how many steps we have done in total from this exercise plan
3)  Workout out the median amount of steps we have done on this exercise plan
4)  Comment your code

```{r}
# your code here
steps <- seq(from=1000, to=12000, by=500)
sum(steps) #calculate the total number of steps
median(steps) #calculate the median amount of steps
```

# Indexing vectors

Indexing is a technical term for accessing elements of a vector. Think of it like selecting books from a book shelf. The vector is your book shelf, the index determines the book, or books you pick from the shelf.

![Designed by macrovector / Freepik](https://github.com/andrewmoles2/rTrainIntroduction/blob/main/r-fundamentals-2/images/6714.jpg?raw=true){width="30%"}

To index in R you use the square brackets `[]` after you type the name of the vector to index from. You then put the numerical position of the elements you want to index in the square brackets. For example, if I wanted to select the first element from my vector I would do something like `data[1]`; data is my data, and 1 is the element I want to index.

Run the example code chunks to see the results:

```{r}
someNumbers <- c(4, 26, 11, 15, 18, 9, 3, 1)
# indexing the 6th element
someNumbers[6]
```

Indexing elements 1 to 4

```{r}
someNumbers[1:4]
```

Dropping elements 5 to 7

```{r}
someNumbers[-5:-7]
```

Indexing 1, 5, and 8

```{r}
someNumbers[c(1,5,8)]
```

## Indexing exercise

You've been keeping track of how much coffee you drink each day for a two week period. We want to split this into week 1 and 2. Using the code below follow the following steps:

1)  Find out the mean for weekOne and WeekTwo vectors.
2)  `mean` doesn't work for weekTwo and gives back `NA`. Print your weekTwo vector to look at the data.
3)  Check the length of your weekTwo vector by running the `length()` function on the weekTwo vector.
4)  There are a few ways ways to fix this, try and find at least two different ways.

*hint: the mean() function has an argument called na.rm, type and run ?mean() to look at the help page*

```{r}
# vector with n coffee per day for two weeks
coffee <- c(3, 5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 1, 6, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1)

# weeks
weekOne <- coffee[1:7]
weekTwo <- coffee[8:15]

# your code here
mean(weekOne)
mean(weekTwo)
length(weekTwo)
mean(weekTwo, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(na.omit(weekTwo))
```

# Functions and indexing exercise

You decide to calculate your commuting times over a weekly period. You decide to see if you can workout, based off your weekly commute, how much commuting you will do on average this month.

1)  Replicate the commute variable four times using `rep()` and assign to a variable called commute_est.
2)  Calculate the mean of commute_est and assign to a variable called aveCommute.
3)  Round the value of aveCommute to two decimal places using `round()` and assign to aveCommute.
4)  You miss timed your Tuesday commute, it should be 37 instead of 33. To make replacement easier use `sort()` on commute_est, and assign to a variable called commute_sort.
5)  Replace the 33 values with 37 using indexing in the variable commute_sort.
6)  Re-calculate and round aveCommute as per instructions two and three.
7)  Test out the following functions on the commute_sort variable: `unique()` and `sort(commute, decreasing = TRUE)`.

```{r}
commute <- c(41, 33, 44, 52, 36, 39)
# your code here

commute_est <- rep(commute, times=4) #1.replicate 4 times
commute_est

aveCommute <- round(mean(commute_est),digits=2) #2-3.calculate the mean,round it up
aveCommute

commute_sort <-sort(commute_est) #4.sort (pull 33 to top positions)
commute_sort

commute_sort[1:4] <- 37 #5.replace 33 with 37
commute_sort

new_aveCommute <- round(mean(commute_sort),digits=2) #6.recalculate
new_aveCommute

unique(commute_sort) #7. unique 
sort(commute,decreasing=TRUE) #7.decreasing sort
```

# Strings

So far in our previous sessions we have only been working with numbers and integers. Strings are text based data which R calls **characters**.

![](https://github.com/andrewmoles2/rTrainIntroduction/blob/main/r-fundamentals-2/images/22895-NUNWT2.jpg?raw=true){width="50%"}

To code a string you need to use quotation marks. You can use either single or double quotes, depending on your preference. When printing the result, R will always use double quotation marks.

```{r}
instrument <- "Violin"
instrument
instruments <- c('Violin', 'Cello', 'Viola')
instruments
```

You can use both types of quotation marks in conjunction to add grammar to strings.

```{r}
day <- "It's a 'lovely' day"
day
```

## String indexing exercise

1)  Make a vector called orangeVeg with the following strings: Pumpkin, Carrot, Butternut Squash, Sweet Potato
2)  Use the `class()` function to see what data type orangeVeg is
3)  From orangeVeg select everything but carrot using indexing
4)  From orangeVeg select just Pumpkin and Butternut Squash using indexing

```{r}
# your code here
orangeVeg <- c('Pumpkin', 'Carrot', 'Butternut Squash', 'Sweet Potato')
class(orangeVeg)
orangeVeg[c(1,3,4)]
orangeVeg[c(1,3)]
```

# Introduction to factors

Factors in R are a way to represent and work with categorical data. Categorical data has fixed values, for example, the months of the year (January, February etc.). Factors allow you to do analysis with strings by categorising them, this gives you values you can do an analysis on.

In the examples below we are going to categorise a vector that contains the strings carrot and potato. There are a few different ways to make a factor in R, the primary function to do this is `factor()`.

```{r}
veg <- c("carrot", "potato", "carrot", "carrot", "potato", "carrot")
veg <- factor(veg)
veg
```

We created the vector then made it into a factor. We can also just add the values straight into `factor()`.

```{r}
veg <- factor(c("carrot", "potato", "potato", "potato", "potato", "carrot"))
veg
```

To interpret the output, the first line shows all the variables in the veg vector, the second line (*levels:*) gives you the categories. In this case we have two: carrot and potato. This is helpful as it tells us that in the vector veg, the two categories we have are potatoes or carrots; these categories are represented as levels in the output.

Why make strings into factors? Other than being easier to work with, factors help you to avoid typos (will give error) and can be sorted in helpful and meaningful ways which is particularly helpful when visualising data.

## Factors exercise

In this debugging exercise, get the below code to run to make the fruit vector a factor. There are three errors in the code. Run the code and use the printed error message to help you find the errors.

What is the `table()` function doing, and does the output make sense?

```{r error=TRUE}
fruit <- Factor(c('apple' 'pear', 'grape', 'apple', 'banana', grape))
fruit
table(fruit)
```

# Type conversions

In the workshops so far we have covered several types of data including strings, numeric, integer, and factors. Sometimes when working with data it is necessary to convert the type of data so you can work with it in a different way.

For example, here we will convert numbers to characters using the `as.character()` function. Notice after conversion the speech marks around each number indicating it is a character. The most common type conversion functions are: `as.numeric()`, `as.integer()`, `as.factor()`, `as.character()`.

A simple example of why type conversion is useful is when a number is accidentally coded as a string. In order to do calculations on that data you need to convert it.

```{r error=TRUE}
# numbers as characters
numbers <- c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7")
numbers
# calculate sum (doesn't work)
sum(numbers)
# convert to numeric and try sum again
numbers <- as.numeric(numbers)
sum(numbers)
```

## Type conversion exercise

Using the meditation_time variable defined below:

1)  Use the mean function on the `meditation_time` variable
2)  Why did it not work?
3)  Which function do you need to change the meditation_time vector to be numeric?
4)  Once you've changed meditation_time to numeric, run `mean()` on the meditation_time vector again

```{r error=TRUE}
meditation_time <- c(10, 17, 5, 16, '8', 22, 9)

# your code here

```

The syntax for type conversions in R always start with `as.` then whatever you're converting to, such as `numeric`.

# String manipulation exercise

We can manipulate and concatenate strings in several ways in R. Two very useful functions are `paste()` and `paste0()`.

Using the code chunk below:

1)  Enter your name and your favourite food as strings
2)  Add the variables name and fav_food to the `paste0()` function. You should get an output that looks something like: "My name is Andrew and I my favourite food is Pizza"
3)  Recreate what you did with `paste0()` and use `paste()` instead
4)  What is the difference between `paste()` and `paste0()`?

```{r error=TRUE}
name <- ""
fav_food <- ""

paste0("My name is ", , " and I my favourite food is ", )

paste()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Extra exercises

Below are some optional extra exercises for you to attempt if you have time.

## Reassigning variables

You can also change the value of a variable you have already assigned. Here we are going to sum our new paycheck with our previous bank balance.

*Run this code to test it out:*

```{r}
# create variables
BankBalance <- 100
PayCheck <- 250
# sum old bank balance and pay check, assigning result to bank balance
BankBalance <- BankBalance + PayCheck
# print bank balance
BankBalance
```

Note that if you run the `BankBalance <- BankBalance + PayCheck` line of code twice you will get a higher bank balance (600 rather than 350). This is because code works sequentially in R and the order you run commands matters. See the example below on what happens if we repeat adding numbers to a total.

```{r}
# variables
number <- 5
total <- 0
# adding number to total
total <- total + number
total
total <- total + number
total
total <- total + number
total
```

## Reassigning variables exercise

Try and sum another paycheck of £50 with the bank balance variable.

1)  Make a variable called PayCheck2 with a value of 50
2)  Assign BankBalance, and calculate BankBalance + PayCheck2
3)  Print the outcome
4)  You go out for dinner with friends and spend 36.55. Make a variable called dinner with the value of 36.55
5)  Assign BankBalance, and calculate BankBalance - dinner
6)  Print the outcome *hint: if this doesn't work run the code chunk with the bank balance variable*

```{r}
# your code here

```

## Overall grade calculation debugging exercise

Debug the code below that is finding the weighted average of a student's coursework and exam scores. You should find three errors:

-   logic (maths) error
-   syntax error
-   naming error

```{r error=TRUE}
# Exercise: weighted average debugging
exam1 <- 52
coursework1 <- 82
exam2 <- 78
coursework2 < 48 

cw_weight <- 0.4
ex_weight <- 0.6

course1 <- (exam1 * ex_weight) + (coursework * cw_weight) 
course2 <- (exam2 * ex_weight) + (coursework2 * cw_weight)

overall_grade <- (course1 + course2)/3 

overall_grade
```

## Salary calculation exercise

Robin and Charlie are a married couple, one gets paid an hourly rate, and the other has an annual salary. They want to workout how much annual salary they have combined before tax. Out of interest Charlie also wants to know what her hourly rate is before tax.

They used simple calculations using the following formulas:

(number hours worked per week x hourly rate) x number of weeks worked = annual salary (annual salary ÷ number of weeks in a year) ÷ hours worked per week = hourly rate

Re-arrange the code so the calculations run. You should have both the combined salary and Charlie's hourly rate calculations printed.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Note: Hours worked, salaries and weeks in year can be in any order but need
# to be above the rest of the code

# weeks in year
weeksYear <- 52

# Charlies hourly rate
Charlie_HourlyRate <- (Charlie_annualSary / weeksYear)/Charlie_hoursPerWeek
Charlie_HourlyRate

# salaries
Robin_HourlyRate <- 16.5
Charlie_annualSary <- 31800

# Combined salaries
CombinedSalaries <- Robin_annualSalary + Charlie_annualSary
CombinedSalaries

# Robins annual salary
Robin_annualSalary <- (Robin_hoursPerWeek * Robin_HourlyRate) * Robin_weeksWorking

# hours worked
Robin_hoursPerWeek <- 25
Robin_weeksWorking <- 48
Charlie_hoursPerWeek <- 35
```

## Splitting your food bill

A take-home coding task for you.

Task: Splitting a Pizza Pilgrims restaurant bill between 3 friends; Roger, Amal and Genevieve.

-   Roger has a Calzone Ripieno (£11), and a San Pellegrino (£2).
-   Amal has a Bufala (£9), and Birra Moretti (£4.50).
-   Genevieve has a Portobello Mushroom & Truffle (£10), and water to drink.
-   Genevieve and Amal also share a Nutella Pizza ring for dessert (£5.5).

![](https://github.com/andrewmoles2/rTrainIntroduction/blob/main/r-fundamentals-1/Images/pizzaP.jpg?raw=true)

1)  Make a variable for each friend that is the sum of their order (e.g. Roger would be 11 + 2)
2)  Make a variable for the shared food
3)  Make a variable called TotalBill, and calculate their total bill
4)  For those that shared food, sum the shared food with their bill
5)  Comment your code
6)  Print the total bill and what each friend owes

```{r}
# individual coding challenge


```

## Using indexing to change values

Using indexing you can change the value of an item, or multiple items, in a vector. This is very useful if you spot a data error and want to fix it in the code. We will using similar principles in later sessions.

This is a combination of what we have learned so far, with reassigning data to variables/vectors and indexing. For example, `data[1] <- 5` means we take the first element (or data point) from data, and assign the number 5 as a replacement.

Run the code below to see the example:

```{r}
someNumbers <- c(4, 26, 11, 15, 18, 9, 3, 1)
someNumbers
# Change one item
someNumbers[8] <- 50
someNumbers
# Change multiple
someNumbers[1:3] <- c(19, 20, 21)
someNumbers
```

In the first change, we changed the 8th element of the someNumbers data to 50 (it was 1 previously). In the second change, we changed the first, second and third elements to 19, 20, and 21 (changing from 4, 26, 11).

## Indexing exercise 2

You decided to track your total monthly expenditures for the year to find out more about your monthly spending. You're interested in your spending per quarter, biggest spending month, and lowest spending month.

1)  Make a variable called myExpenses with the following data: 976, 631, 1231, 1120, 1374, 873, 1244, 1398, 989, 1034, 579 and 1506. Each item represents each month, first is January spending, second is February spending etc.
2)  You realise the spending for some of the months is wrong. January should be 921, August should be 1419, and November should be 703. Use indexing to change the values in myExpenses so they are correct.\
3)  Using indexing make a vector for the first quarter of the year. Call it Q1 and make sure the first three months are indexed.
4)  Repeat for quarters 2, 3, and 4.
5)  Workout the average spending for each quarter. Which had the biggest spending?
6)  Using the `which.max()` and `which.min()` functions on your myExpenses vector, find out which months had the highest and lowest spending. Assign the result of each to a variable (minSpend, maxSpend).
7)  Now you know the highest and lowest spending months, put them into a vector together called MaxMin by indexing from the myExpenses vector.

## Finding Lional Messi's best season

For this individual coding challenge we will be looking at Lional Messi's season appearances and goals from 2004-2020.

The code below has been jumbled up and will not run. Your challenge is to re-order it so it runs correctly. It should print out summary statistics for season goal ratio and age band goal ratios, as well as which year was his most and least prolific, and how many years that took him.

```{r error=TRUE}
# print career ratio
careerGoalRatio

# which season had the worst goal ratio
season[which.max(goalRatio)]

# combine age band ratios to a vector
ageGoalRatio <- c(round(mean(teenageGoalRatio), digits = 2), 
              round(mean(twentiesGoalRatio), digits = 2),
              round(mean(thirtiesGoalRatio), digits = 2))

# add in appearance, goal and season data
appearances <- c(9,25,36,40,51,53,55,60,50,46,57,49,52,54,50,44)
goals <- c(1,8,17,16,38,47,53,73,60,41,58,41,54,45,51,31)
season <- c(2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,
            2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019)

# which season had the best goal ratio
season[which.min(goalRatio)]

# goal ratio per age band (teenager, 20's, 30's)

## Ordering factors

Sometimes the ordering of the factor levels matter. For example, if you had a question on how fast someone eats ice cream with the possible answers of *slow, medium, and fast*, the order is important. This order reflects how the output will be printed or arranged in a figure.

![](https://github.com/andrewmoles2/rTrainIntroduction/blob/main/r-fundamentals-3/images/dog_order.jpg?raw=true){width="50%"}

Run the below example. Can you see that the order is the wrong way round? We want slow to be first, then medium, then fast.

```{r}
iceCream <- factor(c('slow', 'fast', 'fast', 'fast', 
                     'medium','slow','medium', 'slow'))
iceCream
```

Factors by default are ordered alphabetically. There are a few ways of changing this, the simplest of which is to include the `levels` argument in the `factor()` function.

Using our example above we add the *levels* argument after the variables (`factor(variables, levels = )`).

```{r}
iceCream <- factor(c('slow', 'fast', 'fast', 'fast', 
                     'medium','slow','medium', 'slow'), 
                   levels = c('slow','medium','fast'))
iceCream
```

We can also add the levels after the factor has been created, by reassigning it and adding the levels argument.

```{r}
iceCream <- factor(iceCream, levels = c('slow','medium','fast'))
iceCream
```

Finally, you can pre-define the levels in a vector before adding them as levels.

```{r}
qlevels <- c('slow','medium','fast')

iceCream <- factor(c('slow', 'fast', 'fast', 'fast', 
                     'medium','slow','medium', 'slow'), 
                   levels = qlevels)
iceCream
```

## Factor levels task

1)  Make the sizes vector below into a factor, making sure to put the sizes in the following order: low, medium, high.
2)  Print the newly factorised sizes vector to see the outcome
3)  Now try and reverse the factor order to: high, medium, low and save the variable
4)  Print the reversed variable

```{r}
sizes <- c('high', 'low', 'medium', 'low', 'high')

# your code here

```

## Basic string manipulation

R comes with several useful functions for manipulating strings, today we will just look at `paste()`, `paste0()`.

The paste functions are useful for producing nice outputs for reports or an analysis. They concatenate strings and variables to make outputs more readable. They are also really helpful to creating data, or making reproducible examples of data.

The most basic use of paste is just adding strings to the function to combine them into one string.

```{r}
# printing strings hello and world
paste("hello",  "world")

# Making a string variable more readable
Name <- "Rose"
my_name <- paste("My name is", Name)
my_name
```

We can combine paste with other functions such as rep or seq to make new vectors. This is really handy if you want or need to make some string based data.

```{r}
# repeat hello 
hello <- rep(paste("Hello,", "nice to see you"), 3)
hello
# person id 1 to 5
person <- paste("person", "id", seq(1:5))
person
```

The `paste()` function has two extra arguments, `sep` and `collapse.` What do sep and collapse do? They tell paste how to separate the elements. Collapse is used when you give paste a vector, sep is for when you have single values (variables). You have to provide the symbols used to separate the elements, such as a comma.

Some examples of paste with and without the sep or collapse arguments:

```{r}
# Using sep
paste("Hi", "there")
paste("Hi", "there", sep = ", ")
paste("person", "id", seq(1:5), sep = "_")
# using collapse
trees <- c('Oak', 'Willow', 'Redwood')
paste(trees)
paste(trees, collapse = " and ")
paste(trees, collapse = ", ")
```

The difference between `paste` and `paste0` is that `paste0` by default has no separation between strings. Run the example below to see the difference.

```{r}
paste("paste", "seperation", seq(1:3))
paste0("paste", "seperation", seq(1:3))
```

With `paste0` you can add the separation you want after the string instead of as a sep arguement.

```{r}
paste0("paste_", "seperation_", seq(1:3))
```

You can't change the `sep` value for `paste0`, but collapse can be changed.

```{r}
pizzaEaten <- 4
paste0("This week I ate ", pizzaEaten, " pizzas...")
paste0(trees, collapse = " & ")
```

As you can see paste can make new strings from existing strings and format them into a readable format, as well as make new vectors from strings.

## Paste exercise

1)  Make a vector with the following flowers: sunflowers, echinaceas, dahlias
2)  Use `paste0` or `paste` to make this string: "sunflowers, echinaceas, dahlias"
3)  Use rep in conjunction with paste to print out each of your flowers with "I like" before each flower, repeat it four times
4)  Make a variable called daysRaining with the value 360
5)  Using `paste0` or `paste` make the following sentence that uses the daysRaining variable: "It has been raining for 360 days this year"
6)  Use `paste0` or `paste` with the seq function to make these strings: "order_1" "order_2" "order_3" "order_4" "order_5". Print out the result
